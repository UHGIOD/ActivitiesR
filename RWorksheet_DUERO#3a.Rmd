#USING VECTORS
#a. You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.
LETTERS[1:11]

#b.Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.
odd_LETTERS<- LETTERS[c(TRUE, FALSE)]
odd_LETTERS

#c. Produce a vector that contains the vowels
vowel_LETTERS<-LETTERS[LETTERS %in%c("A", "E", "I", "O", "U")]
vowel_LETTERS

#d. Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters
l5letters<-tail(letters,5)
l5letters

#e. Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase. 
fifteen24_letters<-letters[15:24]
fifteen24_letters

#2. Create a vector(not a dataframe) with the average temperatures in April for 
#Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban, Samal Island, and Davao City. 
#The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.

#a. What is the R code and its result for creating a character vector for the city/town 
#of Tuguegarao City, Manila, Iloilo City, Tacloban,Samal Island, and Davao City? Name the object as city. 
#The names should follow the same order as in the instruction.
city<-c("Tuguegarao City", "Manila", "Iloilo City", "Tacloban","Samal Island", "Davao City")
city

#b. The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees.Name the object as temp. 
#Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what is in the instruction.
temp<-c(42, 39, 34, 34, 30, 27)
temp

#c. Create a dataframe to combine the city and the temp by using ‘data.frame(). What the R code and its result?
tempandcity<- data.frame(
  city=city,
  temp=temp
)
tempandcity

#d. Associate the dataframe you have created in 2.(c) by naming the columns using the names() function. 
#Change the column names by using names() function as City and Temperature. What is the R code and its result?
names(tempandcity)[c(1:2)]<-c("City", "Temperature")
colnames(tempandcity)
tempandcity

#e. Print the structure by using str() function. Describe the output.
str(tempandcity)

#Description: The object is classified as a data.frame. Within this data frame, 
#there are 6 recorded observations (rows) and 2 variables(columns). 
#Each attribute in the data frame is accompanied by its class and initial values.

#f. From the answer in d, what is the content of row 3 and row 4 What is its R code and its output. 
tempandcity[c(3,4),]

#g. From the answer in d, display the city with highest temperature and the city with the lowest temperature. 
#What is its R code and its output?
max_temp<- max(temp)
min_temp<-min(temp)

city_max_temp<-city[temp==max_temp]
city_max_temp

city_min_temp<-city[temp==min_temp]
city_min_temp

city_max_min_temp<-c(city_max_temp,city_min_temp)
city_max_min_temp

#USING MATRICES
#2. Create a matrix of one to eight and eleven to fourteen with four columns and three rows.
#a. What will be the R code for the #2 question and its result?

matrix1<-matrix(c(1:8, 11:14), ncol=4, nrow=3)
matrix1

#b. Multiply the matrix by two. What is its R code and its result?
matrix2<-matrix1*2
matrix2

#c. What is the content of row 2? What is its R code?
matrix2[2,]

#d. What will be the R code if you want to display the column 3 and column 4 in row 1 and row 2? What is its output?
matrix2[c(1,2), c(3,4)]

#e. What is the R code is you want to display only the columns in 2 and 3, row 3? What is its output?
matrix3<-matrix2[3, c(2:3)]
matrix3

#f. What is the R code is you want to display only the columns 4? What is its output?
matrix2[ ,4]

#g. Name the rows as isa, dalawa, tatlo and columns as uno, dos, tres, quatro for the matrix that was created in b.‘. What is its R code and corresponding output?
dimnames(matrix2)<-list(c("isa", "dalawa", "tatlo"), c("uno", "dos", "tres", "quatro"))
matrix2

#h. From the original matrix you have created in a, reshape the matrix by assigning a new dimension with dim(). 
#New dimensions should have 2 columns and 6 rows. What will be the R code and its output?
dim(matrix1)<-c(6,2)
matrix1

#USING ARRAYS
#a. Create an array for the above numeric values. Each values will be repeated twice.
#What will be the R code if you are to create a three-dimensional array with 4 columns and 2 rows. 
#What will be its output?
Array1<-array(c(1,2,3,6,7,8,9,0,3,4,5,1), c(2,4,6))
Array1

#b. How many dimensions do your array have?
dim(Array1)

#c. Name the rows as lowercase letters and columns as uppercase letters starting from the A. 
#The array names should be “1st-Dimensional Array”, “2nd-Dimensional Array”, and “3rd-Dimensional Array”. 
#What will be the R codes and its output?
dimnames(Array1)<-list(c("a","b"), c("A","B", "C", "D"), c("1st-Dimensional Array", "2nd-Dimensional Array", 
                                                           "3rd Dimensional Array", "1st Dimensional Array", 
                                                           "2nd Dimensional Array", "3rd Dimensional Array"))
